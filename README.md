AU3-Licensing
=============

Licensing options for AutoIT script/program.

##Features
* Asks for a serial (in a TaskDialog box)
* Links to your website to get one
* Stores it in the registry, hashed
* Checks it at each launch

##How does it work ?
* Launch : checks the registry key for the serial
  * If it is there : continue launching
  * If it is not there : asks for it in a Taskdialog box :
    * Link to your website, in order to buy the software (sends the unique computer ID in the URL)
    * Ability to enter the serial
    * Or, close the software

The serial is encrypted using the unique computer ID (generated by Windows and stored in a registry key. Remains the same if the computer sees some components replaced, and if Windows is updated).
Once decrypted, it looks like this : UNIQUECOMPUTERID/EXPIRATIONDATE
The EXPIRATIONDATE is checked at each launch of the program, and there is a reminder as the date gets closer.

##Todo
* Security improvement : provide your own key (which will be compiled in the executable) to enhance security through a double-decrypting system
* Security improvement : Connect to server to check if the key exists, and if the key is still valid
* Moar options : Select if the key should be saved in the registry or in a file, select which algorithm to use when crypting/decrypting key, add a PHP/MySQL server backend for key generation (rather than the KeyGen.au3 script)
